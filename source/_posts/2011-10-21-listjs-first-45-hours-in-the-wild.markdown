Woah! List.js first 45 hours out in the wild have been pretty crazy.

I “released” the script around 22:00 CEST this Wednesday (when the swedish podcast Webbradion 55 aired).

Yesterday around 17:00 the link was posted to Hacker News and within a hour it reached #1. It held that position for around five hours.

Today, 24 hours after it was posted to Hacker News, Listjs.com have had  27 500 visitors, been tweeted 269 times, liked 57 times and +1’d 68 times.

In addition to that github.com/javve/list got 439 watchers, 21 forks and one code contribution!

Craaazy.

Probably the best thing is the amazing response at Twitter, Im so freakin’ happy right now.
