Tonight I added the [http://listjs.com/](Listjs.com website) to List.js Github repository. 
The reason for this is simply that its a more convenient structure 
for myself and there will also be easier to download the List.js 
examples and try them out locally.

My original plan for tonight was to release some examples showing of 
performance and benchmarking, but other work got in the way. But I 
promis you, its worth waiting for.
