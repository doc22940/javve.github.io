                A few months back we made a map over hot startups located in ourcity,
                Stockholm. We began with startups we knew, but got reallythrilled over
                finding so many new ones. The map got retweeted a lot. Wealso made a
                twitter list with Stockholm startups that now has 85members. Stockholm
                is really cooking. Since many people thought thiswas a great
                initiative, we decided to take it one step further - startuplocation
                was born.
            </p>

                Our aim with Startuplocation is that it will be a way for you tokeep
                track of what’s happening in the startup scene in your city. Andin the
                future, hopefully a way to keep track of what’s happening inthe
                startup scene overall.

            <a style="margin-left:10px;" href="http://twitter.com/startuplocation" class="circle twitter float-right" title="Go to Twitter.com/StartupLocation"><span>Twitter: StartupLocation</span></a>
            <p>
                The reason is simple - the scene is changing rapidly and thereshould
                be a better way to keep track of it.
