        <p>
            I'm one of those lucky guys that found my passion early. My interest for design,
            technology and human behaviour have grown continuously since 1998, and today I'm
            pragmatic designer who loves building stuff for the web.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the last decade I have been involved in starting a bunch of projects and
            at the same time almost earned two masters degrees at Umeå university. One in
            Interaction technology and design, and one in Computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to be (and usually am) a part of the entire process from writing an idea
            at a napkin, to design and implementation. My specialties are user experience and
            graphical design, often translated to Photoshop and Javascript.

        <h3>Me?!</h3>
        <p>
            27 years old and lives in Stockholm. Ambitious but light-hearted
            and jocular. Enjoys friends, new experiences and bad action movies. I like to do stuff
            and meet new people, which means that I regularly find myself organising hackathons,
            parties, dinners, meetups and movie nights. I’m a geek that loves people.
        </p>

        <h3>Job</h3>
        <p>
            I’m not looking for a new job. But it is always fun to talk with interesting people
            working with cool projects. If you are exciting enough, who knows what will happen?
