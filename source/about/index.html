                        I'm one of those lucky guys that found my passion early. 
                        Since 2000 have my passion for design and programming grown 
                        continuously. Today I'm pragmatic designer who loves building 
                        things people enjoys to use.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        During the last six years have I been involved in founding a 
                        bunch of projects and at the same time earned a masters degree 
                        in interaction technology and design from Umeå university.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>
                        I like to be (and usually are) a part of the entire process 
                        from writing an idea at a napkin, to design and implementation, and later to presenting the result. My specialties are user experience and graphical design, often translated to Photoshop and JavaScript.
                    </p>
            
                    <h4>Me</h4>
                    <p>
                        I'm 25 years and lives in Stockholm. Ambitious but light-hearted 
                        and jocular. Found of coffee, friends, movies and retro video 
                        games. I like when things happen, and if it doesn't, I'm 
                        ensuring that it does. I’m a geek that loves people.
                    </p>
            
                    <h4>Job?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I'm not looking for a new job. But if you are a ridiculously 
                        sharp programmer with the right mindset and have an amazing 
                        idea, maybe we could found a startup and take over the world?
